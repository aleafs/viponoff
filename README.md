[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/aleafs/viponoff.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/aleafs/viponoff)

## About

## Install

```bash
$ npm install viponoff
```

## Usage


* 在node原生的http服务中使用（`dispatch.js`）：

```javascript
var filter = require('viponoff').create({
  'statusurl' : '/status',
  'setonline' : true,
  'statusfile' : '/var/www/status.taobao'
}, function (req, res) {
  res.end('Hello world!');
}).filter;

require('http').createServer(filter).listen(8124);

```

服务启动，用`/var/www/status.taobao`文件来控制服务的上线下线：
```bash
$ node dispatch.js &
$ touch /var/www/status.taobao
$ curl http://localhost:8124/status -v

* About to connect() to localhost port 8124 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
